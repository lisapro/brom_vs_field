# brom_vs_field

## About
brom_vs_field - is a script written on python 2.7 to visualise results of running Bottom RedOx Model - coupled benthic-pelagic model for simulation of seasonal anoxia and its impact (http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2015-239/gmd-2015-239.pdf) and to compare it with the field data. 
Now it is implemented to Berre lagoon 

## How to use
1. BROM Pictures uses two third-party Python modules,  NumPy and MatPlotLib . These need to be installed to run script.
To draw the output of BROM model you should add text ouput file into the same folder with cloned repository 
The easiest way is to use Enthought Canopy(https://store.enthought.com/downloads/#default). Express version is free and it is enough powerful to run this script. 
2. Clone this repository (https://github.com/lisapro/brom_vs_field.git) into python working folder.  
3. You should place the text output file in the same folder and name it Brom_Berre_out.nc ( Standard name for the output, usually you won't need to change the name) 
4. Run it
  You can run it either on Canopy or just by double clicking the main.py file
